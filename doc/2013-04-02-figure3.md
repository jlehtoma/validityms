## Figure 3 
### Representation levels of feature groups (grouped by spp or fertility) for frx and others

### Meeting with Atte 2013-04-05

Changes proposed to the figure:
* Add 2 more panels with PAs masked-in versions ([issue #4](https://github.com/jlehtoma/validityms/issues/4))

However, Using variant 20 won't do, because it has (rather strong) interaction connectivity component turned on

![alternative version of Fig3](../figs/Fig3_variant20.png).

How about creating an alternative version of variant X that is hierarchically masked, but doesn't account for 
interaction connectivity to PAs?

**New variants**  

`28_60_5kp_abf_pe_w_cmat_cmete_mask`: variant [18](http://goo.gl/O1jSt) without `cres` and with `mask`  
`29_60_5kp_abf_pe_w_cmat_cmete_mask_altg`: variant 28 with the alternative grouping (fertility class)
