__Figure 1.__ Schematics of the analysis setup. Different parts of the analysis 
were done in different software environments (see text). Analysis feature layers 
(index layers) were constructed from 3 different data sources (Table 1 and a 
condition layer (see text) was applied on all of them. Different Zonation 
analysis variants are indicated by arrows 1-4 (see Table 3) with closed circles 
indicating the analysis features used. Each analysis variant resulted in a 
priority maps (Figure 2) and feature-specific performance curves (Figure 3). For 
validation purposes, each rank priority map was compared to a set of independent 
validation data to determine the mean and the distribution of ranks (Figure 4).
