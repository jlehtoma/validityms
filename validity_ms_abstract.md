## Abstract

Boreal region is facing intensifying resource extraction pressures, but the lack of extensive biodiversity data makes operative forest conservation planning difficult. Many countries carry out silvicultural forest inventories resulting in extensive and up-to-date knowledge-base on the existing forest resources. By using different types of open and proprietary forest inventory data sets available in Finland, we investigated how well these data suit the purpose of conservation planning and validated the results by comparing them to known areas of high conservation value also accounting for connectivity. Forest characteristics such as tree volume, average diameter, species composition, and soil fertility are used to create indexes for conservation value, which were used as inputs for Zonation, a method for spatial conservation prioritization. We show that prioritization analyses based on the coarser open data produce informative results, but only when the reference level is set to mature continuous forest areas. Analyses based on more detailed data always outperform the MSNFI-analyses and are also able to account for more small-scaled conservation value. The location of high priorities seems to be relatively robust across the different analysis variants. The results underline the importance of making the detailed inventory data publicly available, but also that in countries with extensive inventory data available conservation planning could be integrated more closely to operative forest management.
