## Abstract

Lack of extensive high-resolution biodiversity data has made large-scale operative forest conservation prioritization difficult. However, countries such as Finland and Sweden have a long history in inventorying forests for silviculture resulting in extensive and up-to-date knowledge-base on the existing forest resources. Here, we study how well different types of forest inventory data sets suit the purpose of conservation planning using. For this, the data has to be 1) relevant for the planning at hand, 2) spatially extensive enough, 3) detailed enough, and 4) generally available. To address the last point, we compare analyses based on openly available coarser inventory data to ones based on more detailed, but not publicly available data. Inventoried data on forest characteristics such as tree volume, average diameter, species composition, and soil fertility were used to create proxy indexes for conservation value. These indexes are used as inputs for Zonation â€“ a method for spatial conservation prioritization. We show that prioritization analyses based on the coarser data can produce informative results, but only on large scale and when we want prioritize for areas resembling existing protected areas. Analyses based on more detailed data always outperform the MSNFI-analyses and are also able to account for more small-scaled conservation value. While similar forest conservation prioritization has been done before, here we for the first present methods to assess how well the conservation prioritization results perform in comparison to known locations of conservation importance. The work has been done in context of ongoing conservation programme and in collaboration with different forestry operators and is thus directly relevant for other applications in boreal forest conservation.
