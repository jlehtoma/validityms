Figure 1. Schematics of the analysis setup. Different parts of the
analysis were done in different software environments (see text).
Analysis feature layers (index layers) were constructed from 3 different
data sources (Table 1 and a condition layer (see text) was applied on
all of them. Different Zonation analysis variants are indicated by
arrows 1-4 (see Table 3) with closed circles indicating the analysis
features used. Each analysis variant resulted in a priority maps (Figure
2) and feature-specific performance curves (Figure 3). For validation
purposes, each rank priority map was compared to a set of independent
validation data to determine the mean and the distribution of ranks
(Figure 4).
