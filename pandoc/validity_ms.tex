Running title: Validation of spatial conservation prioritization

Manuscript statistics: word count (total) = xxx figures = xxx of which
xxx in color tables = xxx references = xxx Abstract: Scandinavian boreal
forest landscapes are managed primarily for forestry purposes, but
multi-objective planning including conservation of biodiversity is
becoming a more common. Most often no primary biodiversity data, such as
detailed distribution data for many species, is available for defining
conservation priorities over large areas. In contrast, data are
frequently available about forest characteristics such as standing tree
volume, species composition and soil fertility. To be of value, data has
to be 1) relevant for the conservation planning need (ecological model),
2) spatially extensive enough, 3) at the right resolution, and 4)
available for the planning process. Here, we demonstrate how to define
conservation priorities in Finnish boreal forest landscapes using
Zonation -- a method and software for spatial conservation
prioritization. Conservation priorities are often generated without
explicit considerations on how well the results capture the distribution
of conservation value. Here, we assess the validity of Zonation results
by a comparison to a number of independent data sets that describe the
distributions of features relevant for conservation, such as existing
protected areas and woodland key-habitats. Furthermore, we investigate
what effect the quality of the input forest inventory data has on the
results. We found that prioritization based on data on forest structure
can indeed produce results that are informative for conservation.
Occurrences of independently surveyed features occurred on average in
areas that Zonation had identified as high priority based on nationally
available forest data alone. The process described here and the results
produced by these analyses feed directly into operational forest
management by the Finnish Forestry Center (Metsäkeskus). The analyses
described here could plausibly be implemented also in other regions of
the boreal zone.

software Introduction

1.1 Operational conservation planning in the forest context (REF)
Conservation planning as a part of forestry management: MCDM (Kangas et
al., 2005), TRIAD (Côté et al., 2010), guidelines and policies (Hanski,
2011), new management regimes {[}1{]} Forest conservation planning needs
to integrate closely with the existing planning context and operations
(Ferrier and Wintle, 2009) Successful integration largely depends on
whether existing data that are already part of forestry planning can be
utilized in conservation planning (REF) and on whether the results of
conservation prioritization can be used in tools already existing in
different administrative institutions (REF) In Finland, the
decision-making context is a mixture of top-down and bottom-up action
and different governance processes (Paloniemi and Tikka, 2008)
Introduction to METSO-programme in Finland: aims, schedule, used tools
with emphasis in ESMK (REF) {[}Not sure if needed: then there must be
many different approaches to forest conservation / management: do these
need to be discussed? Perhaps in the discussion - just a note.{]}

1.2 Spatial conservation prioritization Get relevant bits from the
workflow MS Has been done in also in the botreal forest context
(Lehtomäki et al., 2009; Mikusiński et al., 2007; Sirkiä et al., 2012)⁠
Associated uncertainties often high , performance and efficiency unknown
(Langford et al., 2011), need for (on-the-ground) validation

1.3 Validation of spatial conservation prioritization results Visually
appealing priority maps may influence our perception (as defined by the
ecological model) of the distribution of conservation value → how to
gauge whether the results indeed are useful? The usefulness of the
results also depends on the sensitivity of the results. Particularly, if
the informative part of the results (i.e.~the best fraction of the
landscape for e.g.~conservation) is small relative to the overall size
of the landscape then the results may very sensitive to various factors

1.4 Aims and scope of the paper 1. Investigate whether commonly
available forestry data sets are a useful basis for spatial conservation
prioritization The nature of the data (MSNFI vs.~more detailed data)
Technical usability of the data Adequacy of data in the construction of
the ecological model 2. Investigate how well spatial conservation
prioritization (using the previous data and Zonation) can inform
conservation decision-making in operational forestry planning in Finland
Comparison of the results to a set of independent data sets Matching of
planning scales 3. Suggest ways to improve use of spatial conservation
prioritization methods in operational forestry planning Importance of
monitoring which can also be done as a part of standard forestry
operations How to improve data? How to improve analyses? Material and
Methods

2.1 Data for spatial conservation prioritization and its validation Data
used for this purpose must be available across the entire study area,
not from individual locations only. Source of the data matters as
different data sets have different levels of uncertainty etc.
Prioritization data sets (ESMK + LTI inventories + segmented MSNFI)
Brief description of the data used Table 1: Data sets used for the
construction of the ecologically based model and index of conservation
value (see 2.3 for explanation). Validation data Table 2: Additional
data used for the independent validation of results 2.2 The ecological
model Short description here, more detailed in the supplement What is: a
conceptual model for conservation prioritization In this context,
``ecological model'' means a conceptual model that converts whatever
data we have into something meaningful from the perspective of
conservation The reasoning for translating the information on forest
structural features to something important for conservation (REF) Data
selection by experts (supl.) Benefit functions (supl.)

Justification behind using the benefit functions Weighting of features
and connectivity (supl.) Based on discussions with the experts + web
questionnaire Figure 1: The ecological model. Data sets, the structure
of the index + the selected connectivity distances and connectivity
interaction types. (similar to (Sirkiä et al., 2012)⁠)

2.4 Analysis variants We selected five analysis variants XXX in order to
examine a suite of scenarios directly relevant for the planning need.
Table 3: Analysis variants. (link to Fig 1) 2.5 Interpretation of
results (prioritity rank maps) Spatial prioritization Priority rank maps
for the five variants of Table (3) Representation levels for particular
feature groups (by tree spp or fertility?) for particular top
fraction(s) of the landscape → this particular top fraction could
correspond to the overall area objective for ESMK (will have to check
what it is) = frx Comparison of variants Operationally, how ``robust''
are the results? i.e.~depending on which variant is used, where are
highest priorities? Also, what's the effect of the ``top fraction of the
landscape'' selected (frx + others)? Overlap and correlations Validation
with independent data sets Distributions of the rank priorities using a
given comparison data Other stats (mean, SD, range?) of priorities
within comparison data Comparison to the data (indexes) that the
prioritization is based on (Supl?) 2.6 Comparison between the actual
analyses and the MSNFI-only analyses The selected analysis variants (3,
4, 5, and 7) were run also using just the MSNFI data Results analyzed
like in 2.5

Results

3.1 Spatial priorities Figure 2: Priority rank maps for analysis
variants (all 4). Figure 3: representation levels of feature groups
(grouped by spp or fertility) for frx and others Priorities tend to be
lower on areas with data source XXX\ldots{} General patterns are --
naturally -- strongly affected by the connectivity components included,
but this is scale dependent 3.2 Comparison of variants Table 4: Summary
statistics on the differences between the variants at given levels of
the top fraction of the landscape: overlap. The results show that the
absolute highest fraction (frx) of the landscape {[}is / is not{]}
relatively dependent to which variant is used. The result is - of course
-- very dependent on the analysis variant used Incorporating
connectivity components will result in tradeoffs: accounting for the
connectivity to existing protected areas aggregate priorities near
conservation areas and draw them away from locations further away 3.3
Comparison to independent data sets Figure 4: Distributions of priority
ranks (histograms) in different, independent data sets. Characteristics
of individual data sets (unsurprisingly) determine which variant should
be compared to which data. E.g. the inventory data collected by the
conservation NGOs should be compared to the variant that accounts for
the connectivity to existing protected areas - because this was a
specific objective in data collection. 3.4 Comparison to MSNFI-only
analysis Figure 5: Average priorities in the independent comparison data
sets (barplot). Discussion

Comparison to independent data sets relevant for biodiversity
conservation indicate that known valuable locations indeed emerge from
the analysis with high priorities Data from conventional forestry
planning coupled with a spatial conservation prioritization tool like
Zonation can be used to identify areas of high conservation priorities
Characterize how the validation worked or not with different data sets
Note that results should not be extrapolated beyond the current problem
definition Depending on the prioritization tool used, the analysis and
the results often are static → if and when dynamics are not considered
it is hard to say much about persistence and hence effectiveness.
Formulation of the objectives is thus important and the results should
not extrapolated beyond the scope of the analysis at hand Aligning
planning needs, spatial scale, resolution and the (planning)
decision-making context need careful consideration There is no single
best solution: the most suitable solution will have to be carefully
planned This implies that operational capacity also needs to be in place
in order for the analysis be repeatable and adaptive Learning
institutions, enabling and empowerment important for the long-term
adoption of new techniques (refs Knight etc.) Incorporation of the
results into operational forestry planning -- ``the manager's view''
Antti Opportunities for improvement: Data There are clear differences in
the quality of the data How to improve the data base underlying
prioritizations, noting that data needs to be available across a large
area? What would be ideal data for validation? Methods More realistic
ecological models accounting for X, XX, and XXX Known planning needs
that this analysis does not answer. Enabling input to decision-making

Analysis feature layers (index layers) were constructed from 3 different
data sources (Table 1 and a condition layer (see text) was applied on
all of them. Different Zonation analysis variants are indicated by
arrows 1-4 (see Table 3) with closed circles indicating the analysis
features used. Each analysis variant resulted in a priority maps (Figure

purposes, each rank priority map was compared to a set of independent
validation data to determine the mean and the distribution of ranks
(Figure 4).
