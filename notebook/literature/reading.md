## Intro

### Conservation planning in boreal forests

#### Gustafsson, L., Perhans, K., 2010. [Biodiversity Conservation in Swedish Forests: Ways Forward for a 30-Year-Old Multi-Scaled Approach](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3357677/). Ambio 39, 546–554.

* Already several decades ago, an **integrated model** was introduced in Sweden, with incorporation of conservation measures into the production forest landscape, i.e., the matrix, and with a new component of voluntary commitment of the forest owners.
* Three levels of landscape conservation --> the role of planning methods in each?

**Useful in:**

* Historical context
* International similarities in management/conservation
* Similar conditions than in Finland

####  Freudenberger, L., Hobson, P., Schluck, M., 2013. [Nature conservation: priority-setting needs a global change](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0428-6). Biodiversity and Conservation 22, 1255–1281.

* Concept of **ecosystem thermodymanics** (Jørgensen, 2010)
    - Drawing on Jørgensen’s work, the thermodynamic performance of a system can be measured in three forms, namely, biomass productivity, connectivity and information (Jørgensen 2006).
* **EPU** = ecopolitical units
* The *EcoWise* allocation of conservation resources aims to maximize the capability of conservation to secure ecosystem functionality. EcoWise priority areas are mapped according to an evaluation of two groups of indicators.
  - One group represents biomass storage and production as well as structural heterogeneity and includes the following indicators: vegetation and soil carbon storage and vegetation density and tree height.
  - The second group includes indicators for species richness, trophic interactions and genetic information, species richness of higher plants, functional species richness, endemism richness and topographical heterogeneity.
* The *SocioWise* index for resource allocation aims to capture a measure for the maximum effect of conservation management where resources are a limiting factor. It achieves this by prioritizing those regions that are characterized according to the political and economic conditions, and also by those factors supporting the effectiveness of conservation work.
* The *ClimateWise* resource allocation is designed to measure the maximum probability that the functioning of an ecosystem will be maintained under future climate change. This is demonstrated by giving higher priority to areas with a high degree of intactness and low vulnerability to climate change (Norris et al. 2012; Rockström et al. 2009). It is based on the following three indicators: human footprint index; water stress index; and biome vulnerability, all of which are indicators of relatively low conservation priority.

**Useful in:**

* Alternative prioritization schemes
* Indicator schemes
* Role of ecological vs. socioeconomical data/approach

> The message here is that the developed countries in the north can make a significant contribution to the conservation of those ecosystems within their own territories that provide globally relevant ecological functions and services (p. 19)
