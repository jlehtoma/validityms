## S1.1 Data, results, and implementation of data pre-processing and Zonation analysis

Following online repositories contain the data and results that can be shared, and the implementation of various steps of study in the form of source code or configuration files. Each repository has it's own licensing information.

__Data is still missing, should be deposited in Dryad etc.__

1. https://github.com/jlehtoma/validityms - The sources of this manuscript including text, figures and all coded needed to analyze the results.
2. https://github.com/jlehtoma/zsetup-esmk/ - Zonation configuration files.
3. https://github.com/cbig/zonator - zonator: Utilities for Zonation spatial conservation prioritization software.

## S1.2 Expert elicitation

__Figure S1__: The benefit functions used to scale the perceived, expert opinion based conservation value (y-axis) to forest structural characteristics (x-axis)

+ Weights and connectivity coefficients in the connectivity matrix were decided based on the more detailed classification (feature number 20). For R1 and R2 which only have 4 features, weights and connectivity coefficients were averaged (__CHECK__).

## S1.3 Data pre-processing

+ Segmentation of the MSNFI data

## S1.4 Zonation analysis setup:

+ Table S1: Input data features
    * Include categorical variable for one of ["MS-NFI", "MS-NFI with classes", "Detailed"]

+ Table S2: Feature weights

+ Table S3: Connectivity matrix
