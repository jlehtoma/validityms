## S1.1 Expert elicitation

__Figure S1__: The benefit functions used to scale the perceived, expert opinion based conservation value (y-axis) to forest structural characteristics (x-axis)

+ Weights and connectivity coefficients in the connectivity matrix were decided based on the more detailed classification (feature number 20). For R1 and R2 which only have 4 features, weights and connectivity coefficients were averaged (__CHECK__).

## S1.2 Data pre-processing

+ Segmentation of the MSNFI data

## S1.3 Zonation analysis setup:

+ Table S1: Input data features
    * Include categorical variable for one of ["MS-NFI", "MS-NFI with classes", "Detailed"]

+ Table S2: Feature weights

+ Table S3: Connectivity matrix
