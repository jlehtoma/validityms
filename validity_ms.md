# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Data availability and available data

+ In many applied conservation planning situations spatially extensive high-resolution biodiversity data is not available, but various other data sources from natural resource management exist. For example, many countries having a large forestry sector have a wealth of inventory data available. 

+ Detailed inventory data is often in restricted use, but more and more publicly funded data are becoming openly available (__REF__).
    * open data policies have a huge potential for conservation planning

+ Using forest inventory data as a basis for conservation prioritization effectively surrogate use for the primary forest biodiversity data (species and habitats occurrence data): how well do inventory data work?

+ Setting the reference for surrogacy is complicated, but we have a fairly good understanding what is valuable in boreal forests from conservation point of view

+ Open data and open methods play a crucial role especially in research that is aimed to provide decision-support information

## 1.2 Spatial conservation prioritization

+ General description of background, methods, and work flows from [@Lehtomaki2013]

+ Has been done in also in the boreal forest context [@Lehtomaki2009;@Mikusinski2007;@Sirkia2012]

+ Associated uncertainties often high , performance and efficiency unknown [@Langford2011], need for (on-the-ground) validation

+ Objective of a spatial prioritization analysis can (and indeed often should) be not the highest conservation priorities, but the lowest. These are areas most suitable for e.g. intensive forestry without being too harmful for biodiversity.

+ Usefulness of the results also depends on the sensitivity of the results. Particularly, if the informative part of the results (i.e. the best fraction of the landscape for e.g. conservation) is small relative to the overall size of the landscape then the results may very sensitive to various factors

+ Priorities given by scientific analyses often not verified but rather taken at face value: multitude of available forest inventory data also opens up possibilities to assess and validate prioritization results.

## 1.3 Conservation planning in boreal forests

+ Boreal zone: Major ecoregion with very large geographic extent [@Elbakidze2013]

+ Although among the least threatened of ecoregions (REF, IUCN?)
    * Species have become threatened locally [@Rassi2010]
    * There is opportunity to set aside and/or manage relatively large areas of forest [@Elbakidze2013]
    * Significant role in carbon sequestration [@Bradshaw2009]

+ Much conservation research has been done in boreal forest context on various fields: most impact from implementation point of view on work done in general forest management planning

+ Regional conservation programmes (e.g. METSO) often must reconcile varying interests and objectives of forest owners, but again much of the general context is forestry management

+ Forestry is mostly driven by market economics and conservation has also been shifting into more
voluntary-based models emphasizing the role multi-use and ecosystem services: need for fine-grained
spatial planning.

## 1.4 Aims and scope

+ Selected region and scale,

+ Main questions of the work are:

    1. Can conservation prioritization analysis based on forest inventory data capture conservation value in boreal managed forest landscapes?
    2. How well does freely available multi-source forest inventory data perform compared to more
    detailed commercial stand-based inventory data?
    3. What are the requirements for data imposed by the conservation objectives (e.g inclusion of connectivity and complementarity)?

+ Additional the work presented aims at addressing the following practical issues:

    1. Ways to integrate conservation planning into operative forestry management and planning
    2. Making use of the available data considering the existing ownership restriction
    3. Assessing what kind of (forestry) data would be useful for conservation planning

+ In this work, we approach the aforementioned questions by a case-study of conservation prioritization in the regional forest center of Southern Savonia, Finland.

+ Similar forest inventory data exists at least in other Fennoscandian countries with similar kinds of forest planning needs

+ We also demonstrate new ways of assessing the results especially from forest planning perspective

# 2. Material and Methods

## 2.1 Study area

The study area covers the region of South Savo located in South-Eastern part of Finland (Figure 1). The size of the region is ca. 13990 km^2^ and it is characterized by a large number of lakes and fragmented waterways which covers ca. 25% of the total area. Of the reminding land area, approximately 88 % or 12250 km^2^ is forestry land further divided into mineral soils (79%) and mires (21%). South boreal vegetation zone covers the whole region and forests are mostly dominated  by the Scots pine (_Pinus sylvestris_) and the Norway Spruce (_Picea abies_) with varying amounts of broadleaved trees. Land ownership shares reflect the typical situation in Southern Finland: private forest owners 77.3%, private companies 11.5%, the state 6.2%, and other (municipalities, parishes and associations) 5.0% [@FinnishForestResearchInstitute2013]. Most of the forestry land is under silvicultural management with 2.5% strictly protected. This number closely reflects the average for forestry land in Southern Finland (2.5%).

In the following sections, we outline the main input data sets (2.2) used to build the index layers (2.3) acting as the basis for the prioritization analyses. We then briefly describe the procedure of spatial conservation prioritization using Zonation (2.4). Finally, we introduce the different data sets used for the validation of the results (2.5) and other methods used for the interpretation of the results (2.6). 

## 2.2 Data for conservation prioritization 

Different forestry operators in the region collect inventory data in different parts of the region (Table 1) and for different purposes, but for the most part the motivation is to provide commercial services for forest owners such as forest management planning [@Tuominen2014]. To compare the suitability of different types of forest inventory data for conservation prioritization, we acquired all available inventory data from Southern Savonia. These data include both coarser data based on remote sensing and more detailed inventory data based on visual inspection of the forest stands. The former type of data comes from a single source (see 2.2.1)and the latter from two separate sources (see 2.2.2). 

In this study, we are interested only in forest land on mineral soils. The index of conservation value (see Section 3.1) is based on the characteristics of the growing stock and it does not account for important ecological characteristics of mires. Mires are still included in the analyses, but because mires on average have less forest than mineral soils, they systematically receive lower priorities.

#### 2.2.1 Multi-source National Forest Inventory data

National Forest Inventory (NFI) is sampling-based inventory system maintained by the Finnish Forest Research Institute (FRI) that covers all land classes and land tenure throughout the whole country [@Tomppo2006b;@Tomppo2008;@Tuominen2014]. Main purpose of NFI is to "produce reliable information on forest resources and growth, the health of forests, forest biodiversity, and future cutting possibilities at national and regional forest level." [@Tuominen2014]. We used the multi-source version of the NFI (MS-NFI), which essentially combines the information from the field plots with satellite images, digital map data and statistical image analysis methods [@Tomppo2006a]. Based on this combination of data sources and methods it is possible to estimate the values of selected forest variables such as the average volume and average diameter of the growing stock and site fertility in high-resolution thematic maps. In Finland, the MS-NFI is being used mostly for regional level forestry planning and similar kind of systems are in operative use in XXX [#37]. MS-NFI data has been previously been used also for large-scale conservation prioritization studies [@Lehtomaki2009;@Arponen2012;@Sirkia2012].

MS-NFI data has been publicly available since late 2012 and the thematic maps can viewed through a web portal or the rasters can be downloaded through a file service [@FinnishForestResearchInstitute2014]. For the purpose of this study, the rasters were acquired directly from the FRI. The conservation value indexes used for the prioritization (see 2.3) require that for each tree species group information on both the average diameter and the volume are available. The standard MS-NFI rasters include only one estimate for average diameter over all tree species groups. Therefore, we used an data segmentation method to derive an estimate of average diameter for each tree species group. (__SAKARI__) [#44]

#### 2.2.2 Detailed stand-based data

In the current work, detailed stand-based data means visual inventories of stands or forestry compartments which are usually produced to provide information for forest management planning on very fine scale [@Tuominen2014]. The inventories are typically carried out by different organizations depending on the land tenure. For this study, we used data from two organization operating in the region: Finnish Forest Centre (FC) and Mets√§hallitus (Finnish Forest and Park Service) Natural Heritage Services (NHS). Here, we introduce both data sources separately although structurally the data are very similar and in later stages they are combined.  

+ Finnish Forest Center typically inventories stands XX times every XX or whenever new operations are implemented.

+ Site fertility class

+ Alongside with the forestry features (volume, average diameter etc.), other types of information relevant for biodiversity and conservation are gathered but not systematically.

+ Mets√§hallitus does similar inventories on state-owned land. Natural Heritage Services is responsible for areas outside forestry operations - such as protected areas - and Mets√§hallitus Forestry takes care of the rest.
    * For this study it was not possible to get stand-based inventory data from the state-owned forestry areas.

+ Stand-based data is generally available for research purposes and it has been used for conservation planning [@Lehtomaki2009;@Monkkonen2014]. However, privacy laws protecting individual forest owners make it difficult to distribute data and results that can be linked to forest owners.

## 2.3 Index for conservation value

+ All data used from all three data sources were categorized into four tree species groups: Pine, spruce, birch, or other broadleaved (Table S1). More detailed data (see 2.2.2) contain finer classification into individual tree species, but the tree species were grouped into these 4 classes in order to correspond to classification of MS-NFI [#39]. 

+ Index measures an expert-opinion based view on how the average diameter and the volume of the growing stock relate to ecological features desirable for conservation (__REF__). The average diameter of the growing stock per tree species group is transformed by a sigmoidal benefit function (see SI and Figure S1) and the resulting figure is multiplied by the volume of the standing stock.

+ Index is calculated like this for each tree species group from each data source (Figure 1).

+ Although the more detailed data have additional attribute data to further define forest habitats, this information is not present in the MS-NFI which does, however, have a feature raster identifying site fertility class. The same information is also present in the more detailed data and thus we used the site fertility classification to further refine the analysis by dividing each of the 4 index rasters into 5 site fertility classes (Figure 1). 

+ The distribution of soil fertility classes is very uneven over the landscape (__XX__) so that the very fertile and very barren sites are less common than the mesic sites. This is important because of the way Zonation operates (see 2.5.1): rare features are given more priority than more common ones. Therefore we hypothesized that adding classification based on site fertility will add the performance of the coarser data when compared to the more detailed (and presumably more correct) data.

+ To study how the prioritization based on publicly available data performs against more detailed, but proprietary data we constructed 3 input data sets (see also Table S1):
    
    1. __MS-NFI__: The simplest input data set used, only has the 4 index layers based on tree species groups.
    2. __MS-NFI with classes__: Same as MS-NFI but classified according to site fertility classes in MS-NFI.
    3. __Detailed with classes__: MS-NFI data combined with the more detailed data (where available) and classified according to site fertility classes in MS-NFI and in the more detailed data.

+ Note that _Detailed with classes_ is actually a combination of detailed data and MS-NFI as the detailed data only covers ~46% of the landscape (Table 1). Both _MS-NFI_ and _MS-NFI with classes_ are completely based on MS-NFI and thus publicly available data.

## 2.4 Spatial conservation prioritization

### 2.5.1 Zonation

### 2.2.2 Analysis variants

## 2.5 Data for validation

+ Ideally, the results of a conservation prioritization analysis should be compared against the known occurrences of biodiversity, i.e. species or habitat occurrence data. If such data are lacking, the results can still be compared against spatial data on areas considered to be ecologically valuable.

+ Whether or not such areas (e.g. PAs) truly are highly valuable in the sense that they contain significant amounts of biodiversity or resources promoting biodiversity is a different thing (REF).

+ Setting the reference level to existing conservation instruments such as PAs has the added benefit that the priorities areas are going the align well with existing PAs.

+ In this study, the spatial validation data sets are used to examine if the priority analyses are able to distinguish between them and the rest of the landscape in the form of higher priorities.

+ We use only the location data in each of the validation data sets, i.e. spatial polygons.

### 2.5.1 Existing protected are network

Overall, protected areas cover 2.5% of the whole landscape in Southern Savonia [@FinnishForestResearchInstitute2013]. Part of this the protected areas cover mires and for the validation purposes, protected areas only on mineral soils (~1.9% of the whole landscape, Table 1) were included for the validation. The data include both state-owned protected areas as well as protected areas on private land. 

The data was acquired from Mets√§hallitus Natural Heritage Services who is responsible for the maintenance of the database for protected areas, both public and private. The delineation of PAs is public information, but since the data requested contains other attribute data as well, it required separated research agreement.

### 2.5.2 Woodland key-habitats

Woodland key-habitats (WKH) are a conservation instrument designed for maintaining landscape-level bio-diversity in production forests by delineating and preserving small habitat patches [@Timonen2011a]. The concept is in use in many Fennoscandian and Baltic countries and while their effectiveness as a conservation measure varies depending on the country and definition [@Aune2005;@Pykala2006;@Timonen2011a], on average WKHs seem to be hotspots for dead wood, species richness, and red-listed species [@Timonen2011a]. The average size of a Woodland key-habitat designation in Southern Savonia is XX ha [#35], which is close to the national mean of 0.67 ha in Finland [@Timonen2010], and they cover 0.5% of the whole landscape (Table 1).

Because of potential privacy issues, the exact spatial location (i.e. on scales that can be linked to an individual forest owner) of the woodland key-habitats are not public information. It is possible, however, to gain access to the data when the purpose is scientific research.

### 2.5.3 Recently acquired protected areas

The forest biodiversity conservation programme METSO is an ongoing effort to halt the decline of forest biodiversity by year 2016 [@METSO2008]. Individual forest owners can offer their forest into METSO and if the offered forest fulfills programme's scientific selection criteria, the offer is admitted into METSO and the forest owner is compensated based on the economic value of the growing stock and timber [@Korhonen2013]. The agreement can be either fixed-term (10 years) or permanent. Overall the relatively simple selection criteria seem to be working quite well both for habitat characteristics such as abundance of dead wood as well as the number of red-listed species [@Siitonen2012].

Regional implementation of the METSO programme is managed by the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment which also collects implementation statistics and maintains a spatial database on the sites admitted into the programme. Data is not publicly available, but can be acquired for research purposes. We used only permanent the conservation contracts as the conservation effectiveness of temporary or fixed-term contracts is questionable [@Monkkonen2008].

## 2.6 Interpretation of results

### 2.6.1 Comparison between analysis variants

### 2.6.2 Comparison to validation data  
  
The validation procedure we did relies on few key assumptions. First, if the index layers constructed from different input data sets truly reflect forest characteristics desirable for conservation purposes, then the sites in the validation data sets should receive high priority in the results. Second, we assume that the validation data sets actually describe location of high conservation value. Protected areas have traditionally been established on less productive soils [@Scott2001;@Elbakidze2013] and therefore it is likely that they usually do not represent the full spectrum of species or habitats in any given region. However, over a period of time being set-aside from the prevailing forest management regimes will produce resources such as dead-wood that many forest are depend on [@Siitonen2000]. Woodland key-habitats on the other hand are scattered more evenly over the landscape and according to recent meta-analysis [@Timonen2011a] they contain higher amounts of critical resources such as dead-wood and consequently larger number of species as well (__check__ the details for Finland). On average the size of a WKH site is very small (0.67 ha in Finland [@Timonen2010]) and thus they're capability to support populations in the long run in uncertain. METSO-programme has strict protocol for assessing the suitability of each site (__REF__?) and the monitoring studies done so far (__REF__?) have concluded that sites admitted into the programme indeed do have high conservation values.

This is probably because PAs in South-Savo region - as in rest of the country - tend to have been set aside for a longer period of time resulting in quite mature forest structure, which is reflected in high values in the index layers (see XX) used as input. 

# 3. Results

## 3.1 Spatial patterns of rank priorities

## 3.2 Spatial overlap of priority fractions

It is not perhaps surprising given that the best parts of the landscape probably are best by a large margin and the worst parts probably do not have much forest at all. In none of the variant comparisons do the best and worst parts of landscape overlap much. From input data sets' perspective this can be considered a good thing, because such overlaps would imply serious risks of selecting poor sites if using the coarser data. Comparisons between the MS-NFI and MS-NFI with classes input data sets (V1 vs. V3 and V2 vs. V4) reveals interesting patterns caused by classification. (__EXPAND__)

## 3.3 Feature representation

## 3.4 Comparison to spatial validation data

# 4. Discussion  

Our results demonstrate that 1) Forest inventory data in conservation‚Ä¶ 2) There is a need for detailed spatial data for operational conservation prioritization‚Ä¶ 

Given these results, it can be concluded that when using methodology we introduce in this paper here and the variations of it used before [@Lehtomaki2009;@Sirkia2012]  openly available MS-NFI-data is best suited for situations where objective is to target regions with larger extents of mature forest. Therefore if the spatial prioritization includes objectives for detecting small scale biodiversity feature occurrences such as the WKHs, a more detailed input data set is clearly needed. Given the amount of available forest inventory data in countries like Finland and Sweden, it is very important that these data sources can be used also for conservation planning purposes for several reasons. First, since high-resolution, large-scale, and systematic observational biodiversity data is scarce (__REF__) suitable proxies for species and habitat occurrence are needed. Second, over 95% of the forest landscapes in Finland and Sweden is under silvicultural management (__CHECK__ METLA 2013; Skogstyrelsen XXXX) which uses these data for operative planning. If conservation planning is to be integrated with other types of land use and natural resource planning, it would be 

## 4.1 Can forest inventory data be used to identify valuable areas for conservation?

Here we have shown that Zonation analyses based on forest inventory data can produce informative results, but only on particular scales and when particular planning objectives are met. (__Add__ assumptions about the accuracy of the data). 

Protected areas (PAs) did come out with relatively high priorities in variants based on MS-NFI or MS-NFI with classes (fig. 5A-5D). Sites acquired into METSO-programme had also relatively high median priorities potentially indicating that they contain similar features to the larger PAs. Woodland key-habitats have the smallest average size per site out of the three validation data sets and they constitute perhaps also the most heterogeneous (__REF__) group. The fact that the classified version of MS-NFI had slightly higher median priorities (fig. 5i-5j) is most probably explained by that many of the rarer soil fertility classes (such as herb-rich and xeric soils) may also more often be designated as woodland key-habitats. Variants based on the more detailed data (V5 and V6) clearly outperform all variants based solely on the MS-NFI data  when compared against the validation data sets. Median priority is clearly higher for the variants based on the detailed data and furthermore, the priority rank distribution shows conspicuous peaks for the very highest priorities. Because of the more detailed and accurate data - also for the soil fertility classification - analysis are able to distinguish small-scale woodland key-habitats quite well. 

The small effect of connectivity (V2, V4 and V6) has on the priority rank distributions of the validation data sets may feel slightly surprising. However, it is good to bear in mind that even combined the validation data sets cover only a small fraction of the total landscape (2.5%, see XX) and therefore the absolute amount of cells affected by connectivity transformation is low. Usually spatial conservation prioritization is concerned about the absolutely best part of the landscape, the defining what is the "best part" is a subjective decision. For example, METSO-programme has a defined objective for additional conservation in South-Savo, which correspond to ca. 5000 hectares or less than 0.5% of the total forest area (__CHECK__). On the other hand, if different conservation instruments are to employed over a significantly larger areas [@Hanski2011;@Moen2014], we must in fact be looking at top fractions significantly higher than few percent. Over larger areas, the role of connectivity also becomes more apparent (fig. 2) as regions with higher density of high quality sites are emphasized. Emphasizing connectivity will almost certainly happen at the expense of local habitat quantity and quality [@Hodgson2009]. Increasing the priority of medium-quality forests that are well-connected will lower the value of other similar quality sites and possibly even poorly connected high-quality sites (fig. 2). Trade-offs introduced by taking into account connectivity will naturally depend on the implementation of a particular method (in or case Zonation), but the issues related to it are conceptually quite well understood [@Hodgson2009;@Arponen2012]. 

## 4.2 Is there a need to open detailed forest inventory data?

Open data has a major role in the play in conservation planning and decision-making, because it enables equal access to best available data, it makes the supporting scientific analysis more transparent, and it enhances the repeatability of the whole process (__REF__). The last point is especially important for applied research supporting decision-making, because underlying may change objectives, data updates, and new information accumulates sometimes rapidly. Adaptivity and repeatability are crucial in translating regional planning into local action [@Pressey2013] which in the context of the current work implies that the conservation prioritization methods would become an integral part of operative forest management planning. 

As our results showed, the highest and lowest fractions of landscape seem to be identified fairly consistently regardless of the data (fig. 3). 

Trade-offs introduced by using less accurate data are more case-specific, but it can be estimated. Conservation scientists, foresters and other practitioners are often faced with tight deadlines and limited budgets, and thus have to decide whether it is worth the time and money to try to secure access to more detailed data if coarser but easily available data exists. We found that using coarser MS-NFI-data can lead to a serious drop in the representation of especially the less abundant biodiversity features such as the herb-rich and xeric forest types (fig. 4). For example, if we are interested in the best 10% of the landscape prioritization based on MS-NFI with classes captures, on average, only half of the representation levels of the biodiversity features derived from the detailed data. For biodiversity feature on herb-rich soils, analysis based of MS-NFI with classes captures less than 10% (__check__ the exact figures) of representation levels. These differences are probably mostly due to less accurate soil fertility classification in the MS-NFI data (...). For the rarest, and hence most valuable, soil fertility classes (herb-rich and xeric) MS-NFI with classes performs slightly better than MS-NFI without classes. Hence, an ecologically justified classification of the data can improve the results even if the quantitative information (i.e. the index values) is the same.
