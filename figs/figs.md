1. Selected variants are 16, 17, 18, 20  
2. Created a new folder validity_ms\figs\maps to contain ArcMap-specifc map 
files  
3. Created validity_ms\figs\maps\Figure2.mxd  
4. IF the whole province (ESMK) is shown, the maps look very alike because of 
the resolution. At least two options to fix this:  
  * Aggregate (with mean) to a coarser resolution (e.g. 600x600m)
  * Zoom in for a closer look
